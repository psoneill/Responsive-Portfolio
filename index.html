            My name is Patrick ONeill and I am currently working as a developer for a Raleigh-based healthcare software company.  
            I have an undergraduate degree in Paper Science Engineering from North Carolina State University and a MBA from Kennessaw State
            University.
        </p>
        <p class="aboutText">
            The reason I am taking this course is to gain a better functional foundation of my current knowledge and to learn about many 
            aspects of coding that I have no experience in.
        </p>
        <p class="aboutText">
            In my free time I enjoy hanging out with my wife and our puppy named JP.  We like hiking, binging streaming content, and traveling 
            to new places that we have never seen.
